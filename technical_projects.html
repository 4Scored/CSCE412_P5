            The most recent projects I've done involve the use of AI learning methods to predict desired outcomes from datasets found on <a class="link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. I worked with the same teammates (on both projects) to plan, munge, predict, and extrapolate meaning from the datasets used. These were all projects done during programs provided by the <a class="link" href="https://ai-4-all.org/">AI4ALL</a> nonprofit. Among the various techniques utilized were machine learning, supervised learning, and decision trees to help visualize results. The projects I've done include:

            <ul>
                <li>Heart Attack Analysis (AI4ALL's Apply AI): Predicted the likelihood of heart attacks given a variety of factors such as age and sex, mainly inspired by COVID-19; <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RfaC6KFQQ2YtPsjnm6iYfnjBgmQSJLQR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108790672827936431359&rtpof=true&sd=true">Presentation Link</a></li>

            Regarding projects I would like to do, there aren't any specific topics, but in terms of skills, I would definitely prefer to keep in the lane of data science-related projects. Any project where I can further my knowledge, extract meaningful data, and apply my work in the real world is worth it to me. Here are some projects I find interesting, some from the <a class="link" href="https://www.aggiedatascience.com/">Aggie Data Science Club</a> (ADSC) and <a class="link" href="https://www.aggiecodingclub.com/">Aggie Coding Club</a> (ACC) which I've went to, and one that I've thought about myself:
        </div>
        <div class="pos_about_notes tech_point2" >
            <ul><li>Real Estate Forecasting (ADSC): Analyzing real estate market trends and investment opportunities using machine learning and certain types of regression learning; Financially beneficial project</li></ul>
        </div>
        <div class="pos_about_notes tech_point3">
            <ul><li>SynthMining (ACC): Creating synthetic image generation using outsourced collaborative data mining activity (according to the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/suryajasper/SynthMining">project</a> itself) using Python, PyTorch, and Cuda; Project that could help me understand how to work in a larger group</li></ul>
        </div>
        <div class="pos_about_notes tech_point4">
            <ul><li>Identifying cat breeds using neural networks: Since I'm interested in both cats as well as deep learning, a project like this where images of cats can be analyzed and patterns can be extracted would very a worthwhile undertaking; Process can be applied to other animals, whether analyzing breeds or species as a whole</li></ul>
