            In terms of service, I haven't done much here at A&M. The service-like activities I have done so far basically amount to helping others understand their code. Most of my current service experience revolves around high school where I was part of the <a class="link" href="https://blueplanetinitiative.wixsite.com/bpisas">Blue Planet Initiative</a> (BPI) and Murals@SG clubs.

            <ul>
                <li>I participated in BPI all throught high school where I helped plan/set-up earth day, as well as other activities such as beach clean-ups and bracelet fundraisers. Money was donated to nonprofit organizations located mainly in Singapore</li>
                <li>For Mural@SG, the club was focused around creating murals in local Singaporean neighborhoods in an effort to boost liveliness. I was a technical coordinator along with a few other teammates (less complicated than it sounds)</li>

            Though it might not seem like it currently, I'm enthusastic about helping people and making a difference. There are many types of service that I'd like to do such as helping the envirornment, helping the community, and teaching others. Here are service goals that I hope to meet one day:

        <div class="pos_about_notes serv2">
            <ul>
                <li>Continue with Ocean/Marine related service activities such as beach-cleanups or pushing for ocean environment awarness, any type of fundraiser sounds nice as well</li>
                <li>Mentoring; Though I don't currently have the skill, being able to to join a service like the <a class="link" href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/peer-teachers/current-peer-teachers.html">Peer Teacher Central</a> over in Peterson would be something I'd definitely like to try doing. I've used it in my previous courses, so being able to give back like the Peer Teachers did would feel great</li>
